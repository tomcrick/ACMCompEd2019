\begin{abstract}
The Institute of Coding is a new \pounds40m+ initiative by the UK
Government to ``transform the digital skills profile of the
country''. In the context of significant national and international
policy scrutiny, it responds to the apparently contradictory data that
the country has a digital skills shortage across a variety of sectors,
yet the higher education system produces computing graduates every
year who end up unemployed, or underemployed.

The Institute is a large-scale national intervention to address some
of the perceived issues with formal education versus industry-focused
skills and training, for example: technical skills versus soft skills,
industry-readiness versus ``deep education'', and managing
expectations for the diverse digital, data and computational skills
demands of employers across a wide range of economic sectors.

All of this is taking place at the higher education/industry interface
at the same time as substantial computer science curriculum reform
across the four nations of the UK -- especially in England, with a new
computing curriculum from 2014 (the first fruits of which are just hitting universities), in which all children are expected to
learn two programming languages, as well as wider computer science
fundamentals and develop transferable computational thinking skills.

In this paper, we describe the background, evidence base and rationale
for the Institute of Coding, its key themes and current activities, as
well as anticipate its likely impact over the coming
years. Furthermore, we reflect on the potential replicability of
aspects of the Institute (and related initiatives in the UK) to other
nations or regions with similar ambitions to address the ``digital
skills crisis''.
%its hybrid structure, key themes and planned deliverables, identifying some of the key opportunities and challenges, as well as its potential replicability of aspects of the Institute in other jurisdictions.

\section{Introduction}

% TC: need more UK context here, I can add this -- do we want to have
% this framed as a paper to justify/introduce the IoC, as well as
% other UK interventions? Framed as a discussion piece with
% transferability elsewhere?
%Set the scene -- UK digital skills, CS ed reform, digital economy, etc

We are frequently being told that this is ``the digital age'', and
that we ``live in a knowledge economy''\footnote{Despite the debunking
in \cite{Friesen2008}.}, with ``software eating the
world''~\cite{andreessen:2011}; nevertheless, the impact of digital on
all of our lives is clear. From entertainment and communication, via
the power and reach of an oligopoly of social media platforms, with
``algorithms'' influencing what news we consume, or making decisions
that affect us every day; to education, health and social care,
through to innovation in public services~\cite{ecdsmsuk:2018}. We are
also seeing the emergence of artificial intelligence and machine
learning as general-purpose technologies that could transform whole
industries and even re-invent the process of invention
itself~\cite{brynjolfsson-et-al:2018}. What does this mean for
education systems, curricula and skills training -- from compulsory,
through to post-compulsory, into lifelong learning?

\subsection{Defining the ``Digital Economy''}

Providing a comprehensive definition of the `digital economy' is
challenging; the OECD's 2002 definition of the ICT sector does not
provide much insight: ``{\emph{...a combination of manufacturing and
services industries that capture, transmit and display data and
information electronically}}''~\cite{oecd:2002}.  According to the
current (but published in 2007!) UK Standard Industrial Classification
of Economic Activities~\cite{onssic:2009}, the ``Information and
Communication'' sector includes telecommunications, computer
programming, information services, as well as a wide range of
creative, publishing and broadcasting activities. Formal sector
classifications aside, it is clear that while the UK may have a
traditional vertical `IT and Telecoms' sector, it also has a crucial
enabling and facilitative horizontal digital sector -- in essence:
there is no such thing as the `digital economy' -- our economy is
digital. While this situation is certainly not unique to the UK, it is
perhaps exemplified by some of the grand challenges identified as part
of the 2017 UK Industrial Strategy~\cite{ukis:2017}: from precision
medicine, manufacturing and future materials, to creative industries
clusters and next generation services, through to driverless cars and
smart cities~\cite{tryfonas+crick:petra2018}.

%\subsection{Diversity, especially Gender}\label{sec:Gender}

In 2018, the UK digital sector (as defined by OECD/UN Standard Industry Classifications) comprised of 1.5 million jobs (4.5\% of
the total number of jobs in the UK), the highest number for the sector
(and a 16.1\% increase) since 2011~\cite{dcms:2018}. 49.7\% of these are in ``Computer programming, consultancy and related activities'': precisely the area the Institute of Coding is aimed at. Its workers are
more productive, on average, by \pounds10,000 per worker and jobs
requiring digital tech skills command higher salaries, at
\pounds42,578 compared to \pounds32,477 for those that do not. Despite
the stereotype that digital tech jobs are for ``millennials'', 72\% of
workers are aged over 35; however, only 19\% of the UK digital tech
workforce is female~\cite{technation:2018}. Indeed, the Institute of
Coding announcement \cite{DfE2018a} quoted the even more pessimistic
``In 2017, female programmers and software developers made up just 3.9
per cent of tech and telco professionals in the UK''.

\subsection{Education and Skills Policy}

Across the world there are a plethora of initiatives and interventions
to address the wider societal challenge, and the corresponding skills
shortages~\cite{cece:2017}. While there is a strong socio-economic
policy focus, it should not just be about jobs: we want, and need, a
digitally competent, capable and engaged citizenry. But this
widespread ambition provides challenges for long-term, coherent
policymaking: what do we mean by digital skills? In recent years, we
have seen a multitude of policy reviews and reports from across
government, academia, think tanks, learned societies and charities
that have attempted to encapsulate some of the issues, as well as
identifying potential solutions. At least three recent UK Parliament
Select Committee
inquiries~\cite{ukholds:2015,ukhocst:2016,ukholc:2017} have, wholly or
in part, focused on the `digital skills crisis'. They have all made a
number of specific recommendations, from curriculum and qualifications
reform, improving professional learning for practitioners, investment
in infrastructure, developing effective pedagogies and the wider
educational research base in the UK, through to terminology, fixing
`leaky pipelines' and changing the wider public perceptions of
digital/technology disciplines.

Alongside substantial curriculum reform across the
UK~\cite{crick+sentance:2011,brown-et-al:sigcse2013,brown-et-al:toce2014},
including a new national curriculum in England~\cite{DfE2013a} and
emerging reform in
Wales~\cite{wgictreview:2013,crick+moller:wipsce2015,moller+crick:jce2018},
we have also seen significant changes to the available qualifications,
based on perceived rigour, content, distinctiveness and modes of
assessment. The publication last year of a follow-up report on
computing education in the UK from the Royal Society~\cite{rs:2017}
framed some of these national challenges in the context of computing
for all, calling for a coherent strategy so that all learners are
equipped and empowered with the necessary skills to be effective in
the digital world.

However, it is clear that from all of these various reviews, reports,
activities, initiatives and interventions, there remains a lack of
policy coherency and connectedness -- more so when it cuts across
ministerial portfolios, or requires multi-year coordinated support. In
this paper we frame some of these strategic challenges -- and
opportunities -- and introduce the Institute of Coding, a new
\pounds40m+ initiative by the UK Government (but focused on England,
with related activity in Wales) to transform the digital skills
profile of the country~\cite{davenport-et-al:cep2019}.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section~\ref{problem} we
attempt to define the wider problem through the lens of graduate
employment and earnings; this is followed in Section~\ref{ukhepolicy}
by the UK higher education policy context and the skills mismatch
respectively; in Section~\ref{ioc} we present the Institute of Coding
and its key themes and activities, finishing with future work and the
potential replicability of aspects of the Institute in
Section~\ref{concl}.

\subsection{A Note on Nomenclature}

While in many instances throughout this paper we will refer to the
United Kingdom (UK) -- consisting of the four nations of England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland -- many of the %specific
initiatives, approaches and funding models are specifically focused on
England (or England and Wales), as a number of policy areas,
including education and skills, are devolved to the respective
governments. We will attempt to be as clear as possible when referring
to specific interventions across or between the four nations.

\section{So What's the Problem?}\label{problem}

Superficially, the employment outlook for computing graduates in the
UK looks excellent. A 2015 report from the UK Commission for
Employment and Skills~\cite[p.~74]{UKCES2015b} states:

\begin{quote} ...``{\emph{the digital sub-sector will need 518,000 workers for
roles in the three highest skilled occupational groups. However, over
the last ten years only 164,000 individuals graduated from a first
degree in computer science.}}''
\end{quote} 

This is beneficial to the individual: according to a 2011 UK
Government report on economic returns from higher education
qualifications~\cite[Figure 4]{BIS2011a}, ``mathematical and
computer sciences'' have the second highest earnings return of all
subjects (overtaken only by ``medicine and dentistry'').  The country
profits from this as well: per head, it is the fourth most beneficial
subject to the UK~\cite[p.~16]{BIS2011a}. Nevertheless, despite the
headline success in a variety of UK Government reports, the employment
figures are not great, and the earnings data are patchy.

\subsection{Graduate Employment}

Further to the 2015 UK education and skills report~\cite{UKCES2015b},
Sir Nigel Shadbolt highlighted the following in his 2016 UK Government
review of
computer sciences degree accreditation and graduate
employability~\cite{Shadbolt2016a}:

\begin{quote} ``{\emph{In this context, apparently high rates of
unemployment\footnote{11.7\% six months after graduation (the standard
UK measure) at the time of \cite{Shadbolt2016a}, compared with a STEM
average of 8.4\%. Note, however, that Computing is 20\% of STEM
\cite[Table 1]{Wakeham2016a}, so `STEM-less-Computing' has a 7.6\%
unemployment rate.} amongst graduates of Computer Sciences and other
STEM\footnote{STEM is ``Science, Technology, Engineering,
Mathematics'' for \cite{Shadbolt2016a} and this paper.} courses
demanded an explanation.}}
\end{quote}

A significant explanation is ``{\emph{There are notable differences in the
characteristics of Computer Sciences entrants compared to entrants in
other STEM subjects}}'' \cite[\P2.6]{Shadbolt2016a}: fewer women, but:

\begin{description}
\item[50\% more] mature students;
\item[16\% more] Black and Minority Ethnic (BME); and
\item[40\% more] students from backgrounds where people have
traditionally not participated in HE (low participation
neighbourhoods, LPNs).
\end{description}

UK Government data suggests that Mature, BME and LPN students all find
getting jobs more difficult. However, for those students that do find
jobs, the data are better, showing \cite[Figure 6]{Shadbolt2016a}
fewer students in ``non-graduate jobs'' or low-earning jobs than in
STEM as a whole.

\subsection{Graduate Earnings}
If we look beyond purely getting jobs to the earnings\footnote{Clearly
not the only measure of job quality, or contribution to society, but
at least it is measurable, and has been measured in the UK graduate
longitudinal education outcomes (LEO) dataset~\cite{DfE2017a}, which
tracks individuals through school, university and into the labour
market, combining educational, tax and benefits data.}, the position
(as described in official government figures~\cite{DfE2018d}, and
analysed by the national media~\cite{BBC2018f}, which also allows the
reader to break down the data by university and subject.) is even less
clear on a microscopic level, though on a macroscopic level it
supports the 2016 Shadbolt review findings~\cite{Shadbolt2016a}.

On the macroscopic level, the reader should consider \cite[Table
5]{DfE2018d}. We focus on the `Men' data as presented here, as there
are (regrettably) many more than there are women in the cohorts,
though the effects are similar. An OLS (``Ordinary Least Squares'')
fit shows that a man reading Computing would earn 3.3\% more than had
he read a subject at random. If one corrects for prior attainment,
this rises to 10.5\%, and 12.6\% if other factors are taken into
account. For reasons explained in \cite[\S4.2]{DfE2018d}, the authors
prefer IPRWA (``Inverse Probability Weighted Regression Adjustment''),
and this moves the earning difference to 14.4\%. For men, the overall
effect of these adjustments is to move Computing from being
middle-of-the-pack \cite[Figure 15]{DfE2018d} to fourth best
\cite[Figure 17]{DfE2018d}, and for women it moves to seventh best
\cite[Figure 16]{DfE2018d}. Note that these are improvements on the
average graduate earnings which are \pounds30,000/year for men and
\pounds26,000/year for women \cite[p. 37]{DfE2018d}. Hence if a
particular subject were sending students into a gender-neutral world,
the women would be showing a 15\% (\pounds4,000/year) premium just to
catch up with the men.  It could be argued that maternity leave and
other factors means that this is unrealistic, but the difference is
due to much more than just that: \cite[Figure 14]{HESA2018b} shows
that for men the mean annual starting salary in Computing is \pounds 25,500,
versus \pounds24,000 for women.

\subsection{Per-University Earnings}

The 2018 BBC article~\cite{BBC2018f} allows us to break down the data
underpinning the official government figures~\cite{DfE2018d}, and the
Computing figures are challenging. Salary premiums, allowing for the
factors described above, are reported separately for men and women,
and only if there were at least 50 students of that gender in the five
cohorts (graduation 2007--8 to graduation 2011-12) considered. This
means that, of the 82 English universities reporting computing, 80
report male data and 30 report female data --- 28 report both. Looking
at the 28 (see Figure \ref{fig:BBC}), one's first impression is that
the male and female data are uncorrelated: for example the two
universities with male premiums just above +\pounds2500 have female
premiums of +\pounds9325 and -\pounds5793. There is in fact a definite
($p=0.0034$) positive correlation, but a fairly weak one
($R^2=0.286$). The best fit is $W=0.92672+0.53388*M$. For the reasons
explained at the end of the previous section, the ideal
``gender-neural" fit would be $W=4+M$. Both these lines are presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:BBC}.

\subsection{Skills Mismatch}\label{sec:Skills}

There is a widespread and longstanding complaint that ``students
aren't industry-ready'', or ``there is a skills mismatch''. Some of
this is due to a misapprehension on the part of employers -- and
perhaps misunderstanding of the nature of education versus training
(for example, exhibited by those outside the IT industry itself, but
seeking to hire people with ``10 years experience of programming in
Ruby''), but much of it is genuine. Previous work in this space has
focused on the evidence based for how programming and software
engineering is taught at degree
level~\cite{davenport-et-al:latice2016,murphy-et-al:programming2017,simon-et-al:sigcse2018}. One
of the main challenges for the university community is to better
understand this complaint.

\section{UK Higher Education Policy Context}\label{ukhepolicy}

After the UK Government's acceptance of a 2010 review into higher
education funding and student finance~\cite{BIS2010a}, students in
England pay probably the highest\footnote{Or possibly second-highest
after US students, but the US averages in \cite[Table B5.1]{OECD2016a}
conceal an enormous variation.} prices in the world for undergraduate
education: between \pounds6000 and \pounds9000/year for tuition
alone. While this is normally covered by student loans repaid on an
income-contingent basis, essentially through a 9\% income tax premium,
there is evidence~\cite{CallenderMason2017a} that this ``contribute[s]
to lower rates of planned H[igher] E[ducation] participation by
lower-classstudents''.

\subsection{Teaching Excellence Framework}

UK universities have been judged, very publicly, on their research for
the last thirty years by a large-scale national Research Assessment
Exercise (RAE), and its successor the Research Evaluation Framework
(REF). This has led to many complaints, largely justified, that
teaching, because it is not measured, is not taken as seriously as
research, certainly in some of the research-intensive
universities. Similar comments in the USA can be found in
\cite{Campbelletal2018a}. To counteract this, the Government
introduced (first grades published in June 2017) a `` Teaching
Excellence Framework'' (TEF)\footnote{Now renamed ``Teaching
Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework'', which is somewhat more
descriptive.}. The ostensible aim of the TEF was to evaluate the
quality of provision for each higher education provider within the
UK. The initial version of the TEF produced a
university-wide assessment on a three-point
(Gold-26\%/Silver-50\%/Bronze-24\%) scale. It in fact used no
direct assessment of teaching as such, primarily being based on
historical statistical data.

In 2018, following an Institutional-level review undertaken in the
previous year, the Office for Students (OFS) conducted a pilot of a
national subject-based TEF. The objective was to provide sufficient
data for prospective students to enable them to undertake an informed
decision about their choice of University and subject of study. This
was particularly pertinent to the UK context as the funding of higher
education has shifted, following several policy
changes~\cite{BIS2010a}, from students receiving means-tested
Government grants to undertaking a loan to pay for their tuition.
% Typical tuition fees are set at around £9k per annum.

%Fifty higher education providers participated in the 2018 pilot, reflecting the diverse range of UK HE within the sector. The pilot collated subjects into 7 groups with 142 subject panel members reviewing the provision. The subject panels consisted of members of the academic community, students, employers and representatives of the professional bodies. Reviewing panels rated a HE provider's subject provision as being either Gold, Silver or Bronze. The Computing subject was grouped with Engineering and Technology. The main goal of the pilot was to inform the development of the subject-TEF methodology to be adopted by the national roll-out currently scheduled for 2019/20. The framework evaluated subject-provision against 6 core metrics. Three of these came directly from the National Student Survey (teaching, academic support and assessment and feedback) one for continuation (retention) and two were related to employment (employment or further study/ highly skilled employment or further study). Reviewers are able to review a provider's metrics against a range of indicators %JHD was "stakeholders"
%including full/part-time students, ethnic diversity, gender, age profile etc. Additionally, supplementary statistics are provided to inform the panel members' review. These include teaching intensity (contact hours in all its various guises) and long-term employment/earnings as measured by the Longitudinal Education Outcomes (LEO) data \cite{DfE2017a}.

The TEF's reliance on employment metrics pre-supposes a strong
correlation between the quality of provision and the employment
prospects/performance of the students. This can be challenging for
some disciplines (e.g. income earning potential is not equally
distributed across all subjects). The intention however is clear. In
the context of students paying their own tuition fees, quality of
provision is being linked to future employment prospects. This
represents an opportunity for HE Computing provision. Those
programmes, characteristic of most in computer science, that contain a
placement/internship, are professionally-accredited and whose
curriculum is informed by an employer-led advisory board are
well-placed to do well in the TEF.

\subsection{Degree Apprenticeships}\label{sec:DA}

The Government has also launched ``Degree
Apprenticeships''~\cite{BIS2015a}. These were described by the then
Prime Minister as ``combining a full degree with the real practical
skills gained in work and the financial security of a regular pay
packet''. The employer pays the tuition cost, but via a national
Apprenticeship Levy \cite{HMRC2016a}, essentially a 0.5\% payroll tax;
large (total payroll over \pounds3m) employers will find there is no net
cost, while smaller employers can claim 90\% of the cost back from the
Government.

Degree Apprenticeships can be either ``Level 6'' (undergraduate/BSc
level) or ``Level 7'' (postgraduate/MSc level''). The Level 6 ones
last three to five years, but typically four\footnote{One such is detailed at
\url{http://www.aston.ac.uk/study/degree-apprenticeships/employers/degree-apprenticeship-programmes/digital-and-technology-solutions-degree-apprenticeship/}}. The
details of Level 7 ones \cite{IfA2018a} were only just approved at the
time of writing, so it is hard to see how they will work in
practice. However, the entire Degree Apprenticeship mechanism does
seem to be geared more to large companies capable of supporting a
bespoke programme, as for example is happening in Accountancy, where
the ``Big Four'' firms are enthusiastically supporting such
programmes\footnote{For example:
\url{https://www.pwc.co.uk/careers/school-jobs/jobs/flying-start-degrees.html}}. How
well it can adjust to smaller high-technology companies has yet to be
seen.

\subsection{Sandwich Years}

In the UK context, a university course that includes a period
working in industry (which may include government, charities, etc.) is
generally called ``sandwich'', and in North America the term ``co-op''
is generally used. The most common model in Computing in England,
where the vast majority of students study three-year Bachelor's
degrees, is a year's placement in industry between the second and
final years of study. This is remarkably successful in computing. The
University of Bath has run such courses since its founding (1966),
with about 80\% of students opting to take the sandwich year. There is
statistical evidence for its success wherever it is used in the
UK\footnote{And at least anecdotal evidence elsewhere: ``the co-op
system is a major reason for our [University of Waterloo] success''
\cite{Watt2017a}.}:

\begin{quote} ``{\emph{...those studying sandwich courses enjoy the lowest levels
of unemployment (6\% sandwich vs 15\% non-sandwich), the lowest levels
of non-graduate level employment (6\% sandwich vs 25\% non-sandwich),
and graduates from sandwich courses are twice as likely to be earning
over \pounds20,000 compared to those who did a standard
degree.}}''~\cite{Shadbolt2016a}
\end{quote}

A simplistic remedy would be to require that all students study
sandwich degrees, but this has numerous challenges:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Some students do not wish to, often for valid reasons;
\item The supply of employers willing to offer such placements is
limited, and often they are only offered to a limited number of
universities with whom the employer has built up relations, often
going back decades;
\item The university needs to invest in the process: a successful
sandwich year programme is not a matter of simply allowing students to
intermit their studies.
\end{enumerate}

Hence we should ask ourselves \emph{why} such courses are so
successful (if indeed they are: there is a possible confounding
factor, in that, for those universities with scanty support for the
sandwich system, those students that do take a sandwich year wil tend
to be the more self-motivated ones, who would probably do well
anyway).

There appears to be two classes of reasons: those intrinsic to the
sandwich process, and the skills the sandwich process confers. The
first class is easy to understand: the employer can view the year as a
year-long assessment phase before deciding whether to offer a
permanent job. From the authors' institutional experience, about 2/3
of sandwich placements result in job offers to the student. However,
it is the second class that we need to investigate in the hope that
non-sandwich courses can learn from them. 

%A major one, brought out
%repeatedly by students returning from placement, is team working.

% \subsection{Team/Group working}

% ``Teamwork'' is often identified as a key skill \cite[and many
% others]{ArcherDavidson2008}. Simplistically, then, universities should
% teach it. Indeed, the British Computer Society has long required this
% of degrees it accredits:
% \begin{quote} An ability to work as a member of a development team
% recognising the different roles within a team and different ways of
% organising teams \cite[Requirement 2.3.1]{BCS2018a}.
% \end{quote}
% The problem is that group working is unpopular with students. Most of
% them have never experienced it in their academic work at school, and
% really dislike ``being dragged down'', as they generally put it, by
% others. In many countries, this wouldn't matter, but the UK has (many
% would say ``suffers from'', see, e.g. \cite{Cupples2015a}) the
% National Student Survey \cite{OfS2018a}. The results of this, notably
% the headline ``are you satisfied with your course'' question, are
% pored over intently by university management \cite[Myth
% 3]{OfS2018a}. As well as the quantitative scores, the students submit
% free-text responses, and it does not take many students complaining
% about the group work before the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Teaching) or
% equivalent\footnote{Whose pay may well be linked to these scores.} is
% beating down the Director of Studies door, saying ``obviously you must
% abolish group work immediately''. The first three authors
% have been Directors of Studies, and can vouch for this.

% However, a BCS-accredited course gives the response ``but our
% accreditation demands it'', whereupon the discussion can evolve into a
% more sensible debate about the size, shape and process of group
% working.
% \par This leads to a curious paradox. Employers value group working
% experience (at a Shadbolt Review focus group, every employer stated
% they always asked potential employees about experience of group
% working), group working experience is only taught because
% accreditation requires it, but employers do not value accreditation.
% ``systems of accreditation more broadly are poorly understood and
% valued by employers, students and HE providers''
% \cite[\P2.12]{Shadbolt2016a}.

% \subsection{Code Review}\label{sec:Code}

% A further aspect of the ``not industry ready'' complaint has recently
% been identified by the Institute of Coding team as part of the
% engagement with industry, and is described by a prominent
% industrialist from the safety-critical sector as follows.
% \begin{quote} We do find we have to train grads how to review stuff
% properly --- both personal (their own stuff) and team/peer
% reviews. While they may have been exposed to the concept of personal
% and peer reviews, none of them have actually been taught how to do it
% properly and how to measure its effectiveness. \cite{Chapman2018c}
% \end{quote} This quote is supported by many Institute of Coding
% industrialists, and also by the work of \cite{Boerstleretal2018a},
% though their conclusion ``Code quality should be discussed more
% thoroughly in educational programs'' is probably too weak. As
% \cite{Chapman2018c} says ``While they may have been exposed to the
% concept of personal and peer reviews'' it is unlikely that many of
% them will actually have practiced it.  One might ask ``but what about
% the group working''?
% \par That is a good question, and one that the Institute of Coding is
% investigating. A provisional answer lies in the nature of group
% working. Practically all BCS-accredited universities meet the
% requirement \cite[Requirement 2.3.1]{BCS2018a} (and ``working with
% others'' \cite[Requirement 2.3.2]{BCS2018a}) by means of a group
% practical project. This is practically always done before the final
% year, both for reasons of balance (BCS also requires an individual
% project amounting to at least 25\% of the final year \cite[Requirement
% 2.5.1]{BCS2018a}) and, more pragmatically, so that the memory of this
% disliked experience will have worn off before the students complete
% the National Student Survey in their final year. Universities with a
% strong sandwich programme also want students to be at least engaged on
% a group project when they go to their interviews.

% But students hate being ``dragged down'' by their fellow team-members
% (it is odd that Directors of Studies and group project lecturers hear
% far less about being ``dragged up''!).  Hence students are very keen

\section{The Institute of Coding}\label{ioc}

\subsection{Structure}

Formally announced in 2018~\cite{DfE2018a}, but foreshadowed in
2015~\cite{HMG2015a}, the Institute of
Coding\footnote{\url{https://instituteofcoding.org}} is one of the UK
Government's latest responses to the ``digital skills
challenge''~\cite{davenport-et-al:cep2019}. The Institute brings
together a consortium\footnote{For full list of IoC partners, see:
\url{https://instituteofcoding.org/about/team/}} of research- and
teaching-focused universities (primarily based in England due to the
origin of the core funding, along with two Welsh institutions
co-funded through a separate mechanism), large corporates, small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), established industry groups, experts
in the delivery of distance/non-traditional learning and professional
bodies to develop and deliver innovative, industry-focused education
across the UK. It is explicitly an industry--university collaboration,
with the Government contributing at most 50\% of the project funding.

It brings together for the first time traditional computer science
departments and business schools, leaders in art and design,
innovation in programme delivery, the industry backing of the UK's
leading digital employers, and the leading professional bodies.  The
Institute's vision is that ``every student leaves education with
employment, and that employers and individuals across the UK have
ready access to the skills they need to compete successfully in the
global digital economy''. It is structured around five priority
themes\footnote{\url{https://instituteofcoding.org/about/}}:

\subsection{Theme 1: ``University Learners''}

% This is aimed at understanding, and solving, the ``Skills Mismatch''
% problems (see \S\ref{sec:Skills}). As seen from \S\ref{sec:Code},
% these problems can be quite subtle, and are not addressed by such broad
% requirements as \cite[Requirement 2.3.1]{BCS2018a}.  

{\emph{To increase the number of university learners and improve
employability through innovative learning methods:}}\newline

\noindent This is aimed at understanding, and solving, the various
``Skills Mismatch'' problems to increase the number of university
learners at Levels 6 and 7 (especially in key national priority areas
such as data science and cyber security); as discussed previously,
these problems can be quite subtle, and are not addressed by such
broad requirements as \cite[Requirement 2.3.1]{BCS2018a}. However,
this theme aims to increase graduate employability via stronger
employer links; hence the Institute is also looking at accreditation,
with a view to producing more detailed records, essentially
e-portfolios, of skills achieved, embedding innovative learning
methods into material and delivery across institutions.

% It is possible
% that these may be supported by a open distributed ledger-based
% mechanism, as is being done elsewhere~\cite{RMIT2018a}.

\subsection{Theme 2: ``The Digital Workforce''}

{\emph{To create learning that meets employer needs, enriches the
student experience and provide in-work and flexible learning options
that are viable at scale:}}\newline

\noindent This theme aims to explore alternative delivery models, in
an effort to identify and synthesis best practice -- for both
specialist and generalist provision, as well as educational training
and professional development. There is a strong strand of lifelong
learning: it aims to champion the role of the university as a teaching
and learning partner/provider to equip learners for a career rather
than specific jobs. In practice this is likely to be largely aimed at
degree apprenticeships (see \S\ref{sec:DA}) in the short to medium
term, to draw in more universities to provide Degree Apprenticeships
and other related course models. These are still in their very early
days in computing, and we hope that the Institute will enable best
practice sharing from the beginning. In terms of content, as opposed
to pedagogic practice, this theme is tightly linked with Theme 1,
notably in areas like Cyber security, where there is a great shortage
of non-proprietary teaching material.

\subsection{Theme 3: ``Digitalising the Professions''}

{\emph{To develop learning to address sector-specific digital skills
needs, build an industrial strategy and deliver modular
training:}}\newline

\noindent This theme aims to develop a new industry-facing market of
university-led, industry-valued provision in areas of strategic
importance. The official description ``to transform professions
undergoing digital transformation'' \cite{DfE2018a} is tautologous,
but the consortium aims are to provide a flexible modular digital
masters programme aimed at people in various professions where digital
technologies are changing the job. Especially in sectors where serious
upskilling in necessary (for example, across the creative economy,
automotive, manufacturing, healthcare, the financial sector, etc), and
also to provide various short taster courses in order to widen the
reach of digital skills. As for Theme 2, this will be sharing content
with Theme 1.

\subsection{Theme 4: ``Widening Participation''}

{\emph{To develop a path from first contact to employment, removing
barriers to entry and progress for poorly-served groups:}}\newline

\noindent This is aimed at addressing the with systemic issues with
gender and diversity, as identified at the start of this paper:
creating a pipeline, with tailored, inclusive curricula. Since
the Institute bid was submitted and approved, salary
data~\cite{DfE2018d} (see Figure~\ref{fig:BBC}) has been released,
which show the importance of a more nuanced study of the effect of
gender in particular. The UK Government analysis~\cite{DfE2018d}
concentrated on gender, but we are hoping to do similar studies for
computer science with regard to other protected characteristics such
as ethnicity, to better understand and address the barriers, to share
best practice across the sector.

\subsection{Theme 5: ``Knowledge Sharing and Sustainability''}

{\emph{To horizon scan for future digital skills need, disseminate and
share best practice of the project, look at long-term sustainability
and the management of the programme:}}\newline

\noindent This theme is an underpinning theme for the others,
providing longer-term horizon scanning, as well as supporting the
evidence base, policymaking and sustainability through a ``Digital
Skills Observatory''. The Observatory will work with employers and
other stakeholders to identify and anticipate skills gaps through
mapping current needs, to build up an evidence base of research,
analysis and intelligence.  A perverse, but totally natural,
consequence of the REF has been the marginalisation of pedagogy
research in the UK \cite{Cottonetal2018a}. This is particularly acute
in Computing, and can be quantified by noting that Australia, with
less than 40\% of the population of the UK, sends practically the same
number of papers to the Koli Calling conference in Finland as the UK
does \cite{Simon2016a}. Dissemination of good practice is also low: a
2016 national survey~\cite{murphy-et-al:programming2017} was the first
of its kind in the UK, despite the fact that they had been running for
many years elsewhere~\cite{simon-et-al:sigcse2018}.

\subsection{Key Challenges}

Delivering as much education as the Institute proposes presumes a
supply of educators; this is a major challenge at all levels for
computing in the UK~\cite{brown-et-al:toce2014}, as it is in many
countries. We have seen a number of challenges in the recruitment and
retention of pre-university teachers (especially in
England~\cite{sentance+waite:2018}), as well as issues with
effectively scaling professional development opportunities at the
national level~\cite{sentance+csizmadia:2017} (for example, subject
knowledge enhancement, pedagogic knowledge, as well and funding to
access courses and higher degree
programmes~\cite{sentance-et-al-wipsce2012}); hence one workpackage in
this theme is devoted to ``educating the educators''.

A further challenge is sustainability. The Government funding for the
Institute is relatively short-term given the systemic challenges, and
indeed will lapse before anyone graduates from a Level 6
(undergraduate/BSc) degree apprenticeship. Hence the Institute needs
to build an ecosystem with its academic and industrial partners to
become self-supporting in a very short timeframe.

\section{Impact To Date}

The Institute of Coding is very much ``work in progress'': at the time
of writing it was just one year on from the official launch
announcement.  With numerous activities and initiatives -- at both the
regional and national level -- cutting across all five work themes. It
has an implicit aim to provide a national cohering role -- especially
at post-compulsory level -- collaborating with other organisations
working on school-level interventions to create the sustainable
ecosystem to address some of the challenges articulated in this paper.

There are new courses already started, or planned to start in 2019,
badged as ``Institute of Coding'', mostly Degree Apprenticeships,
Masters courses, or joint Masters courses and (Level 7) Degree
Apprenticeships.  It could be argued that some, particularly the
Degree Apprenticeships, might have been started without the Institute
of Coding, but it is certainly the case that the Institute of Coding
has accelerated the process, not least by short-circuiting the often
labyrinthine ``quality assurance'' processes in universities, as
university leadership, prompted (to say the least) by the money on
offer, had already signed up to the principle.

From an underpinning research and evidence-base perspective, the
announce of the Institute in 2015~\cite{HMG2015a} prompted the
baseline research on introductory programming in UK
universities~\cite{murphy-et-al:programming2017,simon-et-al:sigcse2018},
alongside a significant renewed focus on computer science education in
the UK -- research, policy and practice -- further reinforced by the
Royal Society's recommendations in its 2017 report on computing
education~\cite{rs:2017}.

% TC: so are we going to talk about the IoC "national" model, with
% industry matched funding, etc?

\section{Future Work and Replicability}\label{concl}

We are now seeing a number of successful initiatives, activities and
interventions which may prove useful to other nations reforming their
curricula (both compulsory school-level, as well as post-compulsory),
as well as in the wider aim of developing broader -- sustainable and
transferable -- societal digital, data, computational and engineering
skills. However, we recognise that there has been a significant corpus
of activity in this space, both in the UK and internationally -- from
existing alternatives such as baselining and identification of best
practice (e.g.~\cite{murphy-et-al:programming2017}), cybersecurity
education and degree accreditation (e.g.~\cite{crick-et-al:fie2019}),
microdegrees, MOOCs, coding universities, industry-specific
university-industry coding collaborations, boot camps, etc -- with a
multitude of initiatives purporting to fix the problem; it is thus
important not to replicate past failures.

When establishing a model for viewing computer science education, it
is apparent that there is substantial diversity between education
systems -- from formal school curricula through to tertiary education,
as well as wider education policy and funding -- and this can create
obstacles when trying to understand progress made in one country and
potentially replicate it in another~\cite{hubwieser:2013}. This is
particularly relevant to the devolved (and diverging) educational
systems of the UK, as well as the variety of its disparate
interventions, especially formal curricula and
post-compulsory/tertiary education.  There remain significant
challenges, particularly around connectedness and coherency of policy,
as well as bridging the gap between the expectations and evolving
requirements of (higher) education and industry.

However, two overarching themes are apparent; firstly, such effort has
to be viewed as a coordinated multi-pronged approach, requiring an
overarching holistic strategy, working collaboratively with
universities, colleges, employers including but not limited to
industry, local and national government, as well as young people,
parents and the wider public. Secondly, there is a need to overcome
the challenges of recurrent funding and support to ensure long-term
sustainability of the interventions -- across the four nations of the
UK -- as well as ensuring parity of opportunity for all young
learners. Whilst we do not necessarily recommend replicating some of
the policy structures under which the UK operates, especially national
quality assessment exercises such as the TEF, they can provide a
useful policy lever for initiatives such as the Institute.

The Institute of Coding thus aims to provide a national cohering role,
collaborating with other organisations working on school-level
interventions (such as the recently-announced \pounds84m National
Centre for Computing
Education\footnote{\url{https://teachcomputing.org/}} in England,
Computing At School (CAS), Raspberry Pi Foundation, Technocamps, {\it
et al\/}. in the UK), providing a platform for conducting research
activities; building the evidence base and informing policy;
supporting accreditation and standards; as well as changing the wider
perception -- and economic, societal and cultural importance -- of
`ICT', `digital', `coding' and other cognate skills.
