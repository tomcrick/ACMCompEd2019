Promotional abstract (up to 100 words: nearly there).

The Institute of Coding is a major (20M of Government money, matching industry
money) initiative to address the national shortage of digital skills as well
as respond to the surprising fact that computing graduates have relatively
poor employment rates, and are drawn from a less diverse pool than one would
like. As well as university students, we are also looking at digital
professionals (with degree apprenticeships and short courses, all with
substantial industrial involvement) and professionals in other occupations. We
are producing a new co-designed industry standard, and researching
blockchain-based skill accreditation.

Session outline (up to 500 words: very much not there).  Also <3500 characters

This session will be a presentation by one of the senior staff of the
Institute of Coding, looking briefly at the rationale for the Institute,
including the surprising statistics on employability and salary, its
structure and mechanisms for industry involvement, and then a brief
description of the various themes and progress to date. The aim will be to
provide enough information to stimulate debate and discussion after the
formal presentation.
