The Institute of Coding: A University-Industry Collaboration to Address the UK Digital Skills Crisis

\leftline{\bf Abstract:}\noindent
The UK is not the only country with a serious digital skills crisis, but it is one with a formal Government inquiry (The Shadbolt Report) and response.
The Institute of Coding is a new \pounds40m+ initiative by the UK
Government to transform the digital skills profile of the country. It responds to the apparently contradictory data that
the country has a digital skills shortage across a variety of sectors,
yet unemployed computing graduates every year. The Institute is a
large-scale national intervention to address some of the perceived
issues with formal education versus industry skills and training, for
example: technical skills versus soft skills, industry-readiness
versus ``deep education'', and managing expectations for the diverse
digital, data and computational skills demands of employers across a
wide range of economic sectors.

All of this is taking place in the higher education/workforce domain
at the same time as substantial levels of computer science curriculum
reform across the four nations of the UK -- especially in England,
with a new computing curriculum that first started in 2014, in which
all children are expected to learn two programming languages, as well
as wider computer science fundamentals and computational thinking
skills.

In this poster, we describe the background and evidence base for the
Institute of Coding, its key themes and current activities, as
well as reflecting on potential replicability of aspects of the
Institute to others with similar ambitions.

\leftline{\bf Significance and Relevance of the Topic:}\noindent
We do not know of an educational system that does not worry about the ``digital skills crisis'' in some form or other. There are innumerable reports, and many Government or grass-roots (such as CS4ALL) initiatives.  These tend to be addressed at the school sector, with the (generally unspoken) premise being that, if only more schoolchildren were interested in this area, more would study it at university and all would be well in the (alas distant) future, as Higher Education will do what more is necessary.

However, the UK Government, with its extremely detailed tracking of individuals through, and out of, the Higher Education, has observed that, at least superficially, all is not well with the HIgher Education sector in the UK when it comes to digital skills.
